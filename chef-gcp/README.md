# Managing Google Cloud Platform Resources with Chef Cookbooks

This folder contains 3 examples of how to manage GCP resources
using Chef cookbooks:

- [getting_started](getting_started/) provides you with a quick way
  of creating a virtual machine in GCP
- [single_app_deploy](single_app_deploy/) deploys a web application
  using Chef recipes to create the GCP resources, bootstrap and
  configure the web instance
- [lnb_app_deploy](lnb_app_deploy/) similar to the single instance
  deploy, but instead it creates a multi instance, load balanced
  application
